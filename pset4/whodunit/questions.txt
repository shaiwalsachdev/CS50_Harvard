1.  <stdint.h> is a header file in C that helps programmer to specify fixed width integer types, more precisely exact width integer types.
They are defined using macros and their limits minimum , maximum values are also specified for each type.

2.  By using these we can fix amount of bytes they use and it does not depend upon the systems.Their size same on all systems.This is useful 
for things like bitmaps.

3.  Size of these: 
BYTE = 1 byte
DWORD = 4 bytes
LONG = 4 bytes
WORD = 2 bytes

4.  First two bytes are 'B' and 'M' (in ASCII)

5. bfSize is the total size or number of bytes required by the the file which includes biSize.It is total size of the file.
biSize is the number of bytes required by BITMAPINFOHEADER structure.

6.  If biHeight is negative , this means it is top-down image (vertically) and it starts at upper left corner.

7.  It is biBitCount.

8.  It will return NULL when if infile or outfile are not present that is file not found error.

9. Third agrument in fread is nmemb - Number of members to read of size sizeof(BITMAPFILEHEADER) or sizeof(BITMAPINFOHEADER or sizeof(RGBTRIPLE), as we always have one member or one struct to read.  
This is why it is always set to 1.

10. biwidth = 3
sizeof(RGBTRIPLE) = 3
Then equation will be ,
int padding =  (4 - (bi.biWidth * sizeof(RGBTRIPLE)) % 4) % 4;
=(4 - (9) % 4) % 4
= 3
Thus padding will be 3.

11. 
fseek sets the file position indicator to a specific postion in the file.

12. 
It is a constant which when used means offset provided is relative to the current file position.
